STUPID POS TRACKING WEBAPP

NOT SURE HOW THIS WORKS, BUT I THINK IT NEEDS FLASK, SQLITE, AND EVELINK

ALSO NEEDED IS AN SQLITE COPY OF THE SDE IN THE ROOT DIR NAMED STATIC.DB

THIS IS AWFUL CODING AND I RECCOMEND NO ONE EVER READING IT OR JUDGING ME

TO RUN COPY THE API.CFG.DST TO API.CFG, EDIT APPROPRIATELY USING CORP KEY WITH STARBASE LIST,
STARBASE DETAIL, AND ASSETS.

I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY FIRES, PANIC ATTACKS, OR MELTDOWNS AS A RESULT OF RUNNING OR READING THIS
